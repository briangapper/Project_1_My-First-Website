                            Plato's student Aristotle (384–322 BC) developed a different
                            explanation for the elements based on pairs of qualities.
                            The four elements were arranged concentrically around the center
                            of the Universe to form the sublunary sphere. According to Aristotle,
                            water is both cold and wet and occupies a place between air and earth
                            among the elemental spheres.<br/><br/>

                            In ancient Greek medicine, each of the four humours became
                            associated with an element. Phlegm was the humor identified with water,
                            since both were cold and wet. Other things associated with water and phlegm
                            in ancient and medieval medicine included the season of Winter, since
                            it increased the qualities of cold and moisture, the phlegmatic temperament,
                            the feminine and the western point of the compass.

                        <h3>Indian Tradition</h3>
                        <p>
                            Ap (áp-) is the Vedic Sanskrit term for water, in Classical
                            Sanskrit occurring only in the plural is not an element.v,
                            āpas (sometimes re-analysed as a thematic singular, āpa-),
                            whence Hindi āp. The term is from PIE hxap water.<br/><br/>

                            In Hindu philosophy, the term refers to water as an element,
                            one of the Panchamahabhuta, or "five great elements". In Hinduism,
                            it is also the name of the deva, a personification of water,
                            (one of the Vasus in most later Puranic lists). The element water
                            is also associated with Chandra or the moon and Shukra, who represent
                            feelings, intuition and imagination.

                        <p>
                            Water and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated
                            into the Golden Dawn system. The elemental weapon of water is the
                            cup. Each of the elements has several associated spiritual beings.
                            The archangel of water is Gabriel, the angel is Taliahad, the ruler
                            is Tharsis, the king is Nichsa and the water elementals are called
                            Ondines. It is referred to the upper right point of the pentagram
                            in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram. Many of these
                            associations have since spread throughout the occult community.
