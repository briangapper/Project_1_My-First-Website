                            Empedocles of Acragas (c. 495 – c. 435 BCE) proposed
                            four archai by which to understand the cosmos: fire, air, water, and earth.
                            Plato (427–347 BCE) believed the elements were geometric forms
                            (the platonic solids) and he assigned the cube to the element of earth
                            in his dialogue Timaeus.[1] Aristotle (384–322 BCE) believed earth was
                            the heaviest element, and his theory of natural place suggested that
                            any earth–laden substances, would fall quickly, straight down, towards the
                            center of the cosmos.

                        <h3>Gold Dawn System</h3>
                        <p>
                            Earth and the other Greek classical elements were incorporated into the Golden Dawn system.
                            Zelator is the elemental grade attributed to earth; this grade is also attributed to the
                            Qabbalistic sphere Malkuth. The elemental weapon of earth is the Pentacle. Each of
                            the elements has several associated spiritual beings. The archangel of earth is Uriel,
                            the angel is Phorlakh, the ruler is Kerub, the king is Ghob, and the earth elementals
                            (following Paracelsus) are called gnomes. Earth is considered to be passive; it is
                            represented by the symbol for Taurus, and it is referred to the lower left point of the
                            pentagram in the Supreme Invoking Ritual of the Pentagram. Many of these associations
                            have since spread throughout the occult community.

                            It is sometimes represented by its Tattva or by a downward pointing triangle with a
                            horizontal line through it.

                        <h3>Greek and Roman myth</h3>
                        <p>
                            In Classical Greek and Roman myth, various goddesses
                            represented the Earth, seasons, crops and fertility, including Demeter
                            and Persephone; Ceres; the Horae (goddesses of the seasons), and Proserpina;
                            and Hades (Pluto) who ruled the souls of dead in the Underworld.<br/><br/>

                            In ancient Greek medicine, each of the four humours became associated with an element.
                            Black bile was the humor identified with earth, since both were cold and dry.
                            Other things associated with earth and black bile in ancient and medieval medicine
                            included the season of fall, since it increased the qualities of cold and aridity;
                            the melancholic temperament (of a person dominated by the black bile humour);
                            the feminine; and the southern point of the compass.
