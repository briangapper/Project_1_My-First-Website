                            Heraclitus (c. 535 BCE – c. 475 BCE) considered fire to be the most fundamental
                            of all elements. He believed fire gave rise to the other three elements:
                            "All things are an interchange for fire, and fire for all things, just like goods
                            for gold and gold for goods." He had a reputation for obscure philosophical
                            principles and for speaking in riddles.<br/><br/>
                            
                            He described how fire gave rise to the other
                            elements as the: "upward-downward path", (ὁδὸς ἄνω κάτω), a "hidden harmony" 
                            or series of transformations he called the "turnings of fire", (πυρὸς τροπαὶ),
                            first into sea, and half that sea into earth, and half that earth into rarefied air.
                            This is a concept that anticipates both the four classical elements of Empedocles
                            and Aristotle's transmutation of the four elements into one another.

                        <h3>Human Souls</h3>
                        <p>
                            Heraclitus regarded the soul as being a mixture of fire and water,
                            with fire being the more noble part and water the ignoble aspect.
                            He believed the goal of the soul is to be rid of water and become pure fire:
                            the dry soul is the best and it is worldly pleasures that make the soul
                            "moist". He was known as the "weeping philosopher" and died of hydropsy,
                            a swelling due to abnormal accumulation of fluid beneath the skin.

                        <h3>Empedocles of Akragas</h3>
                        <p>
                            However, Empedocles of Akragas (c. 495 – c. 435 BCE), is best known
                            for having selected all elements as his archai and by the time of
                            Plato (427–347 BCE), the four Empedoclian elements were well established.
                            In the Timaeus, Plato's major cosmological dialogue, the Platonic solid
                            he associated with fire was the tetrahedron which is formed from four
                            triangles and contains the least volume with the greatest surface area.
                            This also makes fire the element with the smallest number of sides, and
                            Plato regarded it as appropriate for the heat of fire, which he felt is
                            sharp and stabbing, (like one of the points of a tetrahedron).<br/><br/>

                            In alchemy the chemical element of sulfur was often associated
                            with fire and its alchemical symbol and its symbol was an upward-pointing
                            triangle. In alchemic tradition, metals are incubated by fire in the
                            womb of the Earth and alchemists only accelerate their development.
